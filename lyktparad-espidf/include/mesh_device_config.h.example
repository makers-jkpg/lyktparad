/* LED GPIO Pin - The GPIO pin connected to the WS2812 LED data line
 * This pin must be capable of RMT (Remote Control) peripheral output
 * Default: GPIO 10
 * Valid range: Most GPIO pins support RMT (check ESP32 datasheet for restrictions)
 * Change this if your LED is connected to a different pin
 * Note: Some GPIOs may have restrictions (e.g., GPIO 6-11 are typically flash/PSRAM)
 */
#define MESH_LED_GPIO            10

/* Number of Pixels - The number of WS2812 LEDs in the strip
 * This determines how many LEDs will be controlled simultaneously
 * Default: 1 (single LED)
 * Valid range: 1 to maximum supported by available memory
 * Change this if you have multiple LEDs in a strip
 * Note: More pixels require more memory and processing time
 */
#define MESH_LED_NUM_PIXELS      1

/* RMT Resolution - The resolution (frequency) for the RMT peripheral
 * This controls the timing precision for WS2812 communication protocol
 * Higher resolution allows more precise timing control
 * Default: 10,000,000 Hz (10 MHz)
 * Valid range: Typically 1 MHz to 80 MHz (check ESP32 RMT specifications)
 * Usually doesn't need to be changed unless you have timing issues
 * Note: WS2812 requires precise timing (800kHz data rate), default works for most cases
